     <h1> The Dark Knight </h1>
       <p> 
     The movie The Dark Knight is about Batman, or the Dark Knight. This alias was created as to 
     represent the opposite of a White Knight or knight in shining armor. Rather than be praised
     as a Knight in shining armor, Batman must be pursued by the police as a vigilante and criminal
     in order to protect the name and reputation of Harvey Dent, a district attorney who tried and 
     sentenced hundreds of criminals. 
  <br>
     Harvey Dent eventually becomes the villian known as Two-Face after losing the love of his life
     and getting half of his face burnt, hence the name Two-face. Before this, he was one of the first
     district attornies in Gotham brave enough to attempt to ease the crime rates by going after the mafia. 
  <br>      
     The main antagonist is the Joker. The Joker is able to plan and execute his schemese extremely well, 
     and is prepared for anything. He is the one who puts Harvey Dent in the situation where he ended up 
     getting burnt. Unlike the Joker in the more recent Joker movie, the Joker in the Dark Knight doesn't
     act out of randomness and insanity. He has intent, as well as a very good understanding of Batman's
     ideologies, and attempts to use this to take advantage of Gotham's hero. The scope of his mind and 
     mental abilities surpasses the mafia bosses controlling Gotham by miles. He is somehow able to get
     control of all the mafia's savings, as well as finding a way to escape a prison purposely set up to keep
     him and other criminals under watch. 
  <br>
     This movie, unlike other DC movies or comics, is very realistic. Unlike the comics, with magical powers
     and superman, this movie has none. The main reason is probably that Batman would be useless in this world.
     The villians of this movie rely on normal weapons, such as glocks or knives. Batman relies on body armor,
     and his technolgoy is not that advanced. For example, he escapes a building in Hong Kong using a parachute
     and magnet contraption to hook himself onto a plane that was planned to fly over him. The focus of the movie is 
     not to be flashy. It is more gritty and dependent on plot, which it does a very good job at it.

<h3 id="part1">What's Batman Doing?</h3>
    <p>
    The move The Dark Knight is a sequel to Batman Begins. In the current movie, 
    Batman and Alfred are fighting petty thugs and stopping basic robberies day to day,
    while making changes to batman's gear in response to new challenges.
    Batman is constantly pushing his body to his limits, yet struggles to keep focused on 
    his goals, as he realizes stopping robberies makes no change. 
 <br>
    Batman then comes up with a plan to create certain marked bills that he could track, 
    and have that money circulate into the hands of the mafia, and from there, track those bills
    and find where the mafia was holding their money. This plan would have worked, if it weren't
    for the Joker intervening, who caught onto this ploy before it was able to unfold. 
 <br>
    By the end of the movie, Batman uses technology that allows him to use the phone and camera
    data of civlians to locate the Joker. All other methods to locate and stop the joker have failed so far.
    The Joker even manages to escape prison and survive getting beaten by Batman in an interrogation room. 
    The Batman could have ended this all if he decided to break his ideals of not killing anyone. 
 <br>
    But, he sticks
    to his beliefs, and instead of killing a mass murderer/terrorist, he decides to use technology that
    breaches peoples' persoanl privacy. This bypass of personal privacy and security leads 
    viewers to question the ethics of Batman, and if breaching the privacy of people, and filtering
    through what goes through peoples phones was the right thing to do.
 </p>
  
<h3 id="part2">What's the Joker Doing?</h3>
  <p> 
   The Joker starts off the movie with a pretty smart hesit, where he hires several men, who all
   wear masks to hide their identity. He splits the men up, and secretely tells each man to kill the 
   other person they are with, and so on. Each person thinks they are the only ones being told to do this,
   so that there would be less peopel to split the profit with. However, it ends with only a few men being left,
   who are then killed by the joker, who takes all of the profits, and managed to hire and kill an entire crew
   for a bank robbery.
   <br>
   The Joker then manages to get invovled with the bosses of the mafia by strapping grenades to his coat and 
   simply walking into their meeting, threatening to blow himself and everyone around him up, unless they listened
   to and accepted his proposal. His proposal was to let him kill Batman, and temporarily move all of their savings
   to a secure location to protect it from Batman, who was getting close to finding out the location of said money.
   <br>
   In return, he would get a large portion of that money. By the time the mafia bosses unanimously agree, as a man
   in a purple suit with make up on and grenades strapped to his body is not someone you disagree with, the Joker
   reveals that he has already moved all of the money.
   <br>
   Although the Joker was portrayed as a lunatic in the latest movie, in the Dark Knight, there is a method
   behind the madness. Although the Joker's motives might not make sense, his actions are planned very well,
   and he knows and takes advantage of Batman's mindset.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="part3">Is Batman really doing any good?</h3>
  <p> 
   Towards the end of the movie, we begin to question whether or not Batman is truly helping Gotham. Although
   he does take down criminals and stop robberies, or even harms the mafia, crime has risen since Batman has come along. 
   Also, taking down one criminal just opens up the space for another criminal to take his spot. This can be seen with
   the Joker, who puts many lives at risk just to play and toy with Batman, as he doesn't do it for money or any material
   purpose, but for Batman. In fact, the Joker burns millions of the mafia's money rather than taking it. 
  <br>
  A bigger point of this movie might be that Gotham doesn't need Batman anymore. In the main scene at the end of the movie,
  a ship full of civilizations and a ship full of prisoners being transported are stuck in the river. They are given the
  choice to either blow the other ship up with a remote by 12:00AM or both ships blow up. In the end, the civilians can't
  bring themselves to kill the prisoners to save themselves, and the prisoners decided early on to not kill the civilians. 
  During this whole thing, Batman is trying to find the Joker and get him to end this, but the main message seems to be
  that the people managed to save themselves, even without batman.

   The Joker starts off the movie with a pretty smart hesit, where he hires several men, who all
   wear masks to hide their identity. He splits the men up, and secretely tells each man to kill the 
   other person they are with, and so on. Each person thinks they are the only ones being told to do this,
   so that there would be less peopel to split the profit with. However, it ends with only a few men being left,
   who are then killed by the joker, who takes all of the profits, and managed to hire and kill an entire crew
   for a bank robbery.

   The Joker then manages to get invovled with the bosses of the mafia by strapping grenades to his coat and 
   simply walking into their meeting, threatening to blow himself and everyone around him up, unless they listened
   to and accepted his proposal. His proposal was to let him kill Batman, and temporarily move all of their savings
   to a secure location to protect it from Batman, who was getting close to finding out the location of said money.

   In return, he would get a large portion of that money. By the time the mafia bosses unanimously agree, as a man
   in a purple suit with make up on and grenades strapped to his body is not someone you disagree with, the Joker
   reveals that he has already moved all of the money.

   Although the Joker was portrayed as a lunatic in the latest movie, in the Dark Knight, there is a method
   behind the madness. Although the Joker's motives might not make sense, his actions are planned very well,
   and he knows and takes advantage of Batman's mindset.

 <p> The Joker starts off the movie with a pretty smart heist, where he hires several men, who all
   wear masks to hide their identity. He splits the men up, and secretely tells each man to kill the 
   other person they are with, and so on. Each person thinks they are the only ones being told to do this,
   so that there would be less peopel to split the profit with. However, it ends with only a few men being left,
   who are then killed by the joker, who takes all of the profits, and managed to hire and kill an entire crew
   for a bank robbery. </p>
 <p>
   The Joker then manages to get involved with the bosses of the mafia by strapping grenades to his coat and 
   simply walking into their meeting, threatening to blow himself and everyone around him up, unless they listened
   to and accepted his proposal. His proposal was to let him kill Batman, and temporarily move all of their savings
   to a secure location to protect it from Batman, who was getting close to finding out the location of said money. </p>
  <p>
   In return, he would get a large portion of that money. By the time the mafia bosses unanimously agree, the Joker
   reveals that he has already moved all of the money. From the beginning of the movie we begin to see the Joker's
   ability to plan and prepare. Not only has he guaranteed his safety and the acceptance of his help to kill Batman,
  but he's managed to take the money of the most powerful criminals in Gotham without them even knowing. </p>
  <p>
   Although the Joker was portrayed as a lunatic in the unrelate more recent movie, there is a method
   behind the madness in the Dark Knight. Although the Joker's motives might not make sense, his actions are planned very well,
   and he knows and takes advantage of Batman's mindset. </p>
  <p>
   The Joker quickly understands the priorities of Batman, which is Rachel Dawes, a woman he jumped off a building to save. 
   He takes advantage of this, and puts Batman in an impossible scenario where Batman must choose to save Rachel for his personal interest,
   or to save district attorney Harvey Dent who has been imprisoning criminals and helping Gotham. Batman instinctively goes
   for who he thinks is Batman, but is actually Harvey Dent. </p>
  <p>
   The Joker also manages to escape being caught by Batman while under maximum security. In an interrogation 
   room in a special building for high security, with a cage in the middle surrounded and being constantly watched by police officers,
   Joker gets beat by Batman. He survives this as Batman doesn't kill intentionally. However, when Batman leaves,
   a man in the cage is in pain and is constantly aching and complaining about a pain in his stomach. Simultaneously,
   the Joker is asking for a phone call. When the man is taken out of the cell and his shirt is cut open, the Joker also gets 
   his call. The Joker calls the phone implanted under the mans stomach, which sets off a bomb in the man, allowing him to escape
   amid the chaos.</p>
  <p>
   He is smart enough to know Batman wouldn't kill him, and had a very well executed plan to escape prison, as no one could
   have anticipated the danger of giving the Joker a phone call. In the Joker's final scheme, he causes panic that leads people
   to attempt to leave Gotham by ferry. The Joker then stops these ferries in the middle of the river, and on the speaker gives
   the people a choice to either blow the other ferry up using a remote, or to both get blown up at 12:00 PM. Any communication
   or attempt to escape would also lead to both boats being exploded. The Joker depends on the hate of others, and for the people
   to kill the others due to fear and panic. Especially because one of the boats is a boat full of prisoners being transported. </p>
  <p>
   However, the Joker is wrong about the people. In the end, the civilizians wouldn't blow up another ferry of people to save themselves,
   even if it was a boat full of convicts. The prisoners also decided to not blow up the other boat very early on. Batman prevails, and
   the Joker is arrested. </p>
  <p> 
   This is the end of the Joker in this series. His only mistake was underestimating the people and their righteousness. However,
   this Joker was extremely well planned and prepared, and there was definitely a method to his madness, which makes him a very
   admirable villian. </p>

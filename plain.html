<h1> The Dark Knight
  </h1>
  <p> In the movie the Dark Knight, the classic Batman and Joker matchup happens. However,
    where your sympathies lie may not be so simple, as this film challenges common beliefs
    that Batman is simply good, and Joker is simply bad. Although Joker does the cliche thing
    and puts lives at risk, one may question the methods Batman takes, and if he is really
    necessary.

  <h3>What's the Joker Doing?</h3>
<p> The Joker starts off the movie with a pretty smart hesit, where he hires several men, who all
  wear masks to hide their identity. He splits the men up, and secretely tells each man to kill the 
  other person they are with, and so on. Each person thinks they are the only ones being told to do this,
  so that there would be less peopel to split the profit with. However, it ends with only a few men being left,
  who are then killed by the joker, who takes all of the profits, and managed to hire and kill an entire crew
  for a bank robbery. </p>

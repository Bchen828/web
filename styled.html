<h1> The Dark Knight
  </h1>
  <p> In the movie the Dark Knight, the classic Batman and Joker matchup happens. However,
    where your sympathies lie may not be so simple, as this film challenges common beliefs
    that Batman is simply good, and Joker is simply bad. Although Joker does the cliche thing
    and puts lives at risk, one may question the methods Batman takes, and if he is really
    necessary. </p>

    <h3>What's Batman Doing?</h3>
<p> The move The Dark Knight is a sequel to Batman Begins. In the current movie, 
  Batman and Alfred are fighting petty thugs and stopping basic robberies day to day,
  while making changes to batman's gear in response to new challenges. Batman is constantly
  pushing his body to his limits, yet struggles to keep focused on his goals, as he realizes
  stopping robberies makes no change.
    <br>
    By the end of the movie, Batman uses technolgoy that allows him to use the phone and camera
    data of civlians to locate the Joker. This bypass of personal privacy and security leads 
    viewers to question the ethics of Batman, and if breaching the privacy of people, and filtering
    through what goes through peoples phones was the right thing to do. </p>

<h1> The Dark Knight </h1>
<p> In the movie the Dark Knight, the classic Batman and Joker matchup happens. However,
    where your sympathies lie may not be so simple, as this film challenges common beliefs
    that Batman is simply good, and Joker is simply bad. Although Joker does the cliche thing
    and puts lives at risk, one may question the methods Batman takes, and if he is really
    necessary. </p>

<h3>What's Batman Doing?</h3>
<p> The move The Dark Knight is a sequel to Batman Begins. In the current movie, 
  Batman and Alfred are fighting petty thugs and stopping basic robberies day to day,
  while making changes to batman's gear in response to new challenges. Batman is constantly
  pushing his body to his limits, yet struggles to keep focused on his goals, as he realizes
  stopping robberies makes no change.
<br>
  By the end of the movie, Batman uses technolgoy that allows him to use the phone and camera
  data of civlians to locate the Joker. This bypass of personal privacy and security leads 
  viewers to question the ethics of Batman, and if breaching the privacy of people, and filtering
  through what goes through peoples phones was the right thing to do. </p>
  
<h3>What's the Joker Doing?</h3>
<p> The Joker starts off the movie with a pretty smart hesit, where he hires several men, who all
  wear masks to hide their identity. He splits the men up, and secretely tells each man to kill the 
  other person they are with, and so on. Each person thinks they are the only ones being told to do this,
  so that there would be less peopel to split the profit with. However, it ends with only a few men being left,
  who are then killed by the joker, who takes all of the profits, and managed to hire and kill an entire crew
  for a bank robbery. </p>

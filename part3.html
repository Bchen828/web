<h3>Is Batman really doing any good?</h3>
<p> Towards the end of the movie, we begin to question whether or not Batman is truly helping Gotham. Although
  he does take down criminals and stop robberies, or even harms the mafia, crime has risen since Batman has come along. 
  Also, taking down one criminal just opens up the space for another criminal to take his spot. This can be seen with
  the Joker, who puts many lives at risk just to play and toy with Batman, as he doesn;t do it for money or any material
  purpose, but for Batman. In fact, the Joker burns millions of the mafia's money rather than taking it.

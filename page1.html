    The move The Dark Knight is a sequel to Batman Begins. In the current movie, 
    Batman and Alfred are fighting petty thugs and stopping basic robberies day to day,
    while making changes to batman's gear in response to new challenges.
    Batman is constantly pushing his body to his limits, yet struggles to keep focused on 
   his goals, as he realizes stopping robberies makes no change. </p>
 <p>
    Batman then comes up with a plan to create certain marked bills that he could track, 
    and have that money circulate into the hands of the mafia, and from there, track those bills
    and find where the mafia was holding their money. This plan would have worked, if it weren't
  for the Joker intervening, who caught onto this ploy before it was able to unfold. </p>
 <p>
    By the end of the movie, Batman uses technology that allows him to use the phone and camera
    data of civlians to locate the Joker. All other methods to locate and stop the joker have failed so far.
    The Joker even manages to escape prison and survive getting beaten by Batman in an interrogation room. 
    The Batman could have ended this all if he decided to break his ideals of not killing anyone. </p>
 <p> 
  But, he sticks
    to his beliefs, and instead of killing a mass murderer/terrorist, he decides to use technology that
    breaches peoples' persoanl privacy. This bypass of personal privacy and security leads 
    viewers to question the ethics of Batman, and if breaching the privacy of people, and filtering
    through what goes through peoples phones was the right thing to do.
